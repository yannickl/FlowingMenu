## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 10.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Usage

At first, import FlowingMenu:

```swift
import FlowingMenu
```

Then just add a `FlowingMenuTransitionManager` object that acts as `transitioningDelegate` of the view controller you want display:

```swift
let flowingMenuTransitionManager = FlowingMenuTransitionManager()

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  let vc                   = segue.destination
  vc.transitioningDelegate = flowingMenuTransitionManager
}
```

If you want interactive transition you will need to implement the `FlowingMenuDelegate` methods and defines the views which will interact with the gestures:

```swift
var menu: UIViewController?

override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()

  // Add the pan screen edge gesture to the current view
  flowingMenuTransitionManager.setInteractivePresentationView(view)

  // Add the delegate to respond to interactive transition events
  flowingMenuTransitionManager.delegate = self
}

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  let vc                   = segue.destination
  vc.transitioningDelegate = flowingMenuTransitionManager

  // Add the left pan gesture to the menu
  flowingMenuTransitionManager.setInteractiveDismissView(vc.view)

  // Keep a reference of the current menu
  menu = vc
}

// MARK: - FlowingMenu Delegate Methods

func flowingMenuNeedsPresentMenu(_ flowingMenu: FlowingMenuTransitionManager) {
  performSegue(withIdentifier: "PresentSegueName", sender: self)
}

func flowingMenuNeedsDismissMenu(_ flowingMenu: FlowingMenuTransitionManager) {
  menu?.performSegue(withIdentifier: "DismissSegueName", sender: self)
}
```

Have fun! :)

## Installation

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add _FlowingMenu_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

use_frameworks!
pod 'FlowingMenu', '~> 3.1.0'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file):

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

You can now `import FlowingMenu` framework into your files.

#### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `FlowingMenu` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile` file:

```ogdl
github "yannickl/FlowingMenu" >= 3.1.0
```

#### Swift Package Manager
You can use [The Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) to install `FlowingMenu` by adding the proper description to your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/yannickl/FlowingMenu.git", versions: "3.1.0" ..< Version.max)
    ]
)
```

Note that the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) is still in early design and development, for more information checkout its [GitHub Page](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/FlowingMenu/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `FlowingMenu` folder into your project to use it in.
